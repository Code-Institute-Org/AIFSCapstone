## Reflection on Development Process

### Successes

- **Effective Use of AI Tools:**
  - GitHub Copilot significantly sped up the initial coding process by providing useful HTML and CSS snippets.
  - DALL-E generated high-quality images that enhanced the visual appeal of the website.

- **Accessibility:**
  - Implemented ARIA labels and keyboard navigation, making the website accessible to a wider audience.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The website layout adapted well to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Challenges

- **Integration of AI-Generated Code:**
  - Some AI-generated code snippets required significant modification to meet project requirements.
  - Ensuring consistency in the design and coding style when integrating AI-generated elements was challenging.

- **Time Management:**
  - Balancing time between coding, testing, and documentation was a learning curve. Initially, too much time was spent on design, which caused a rush during the implementation phase.

### Learnings

- **Better Planning:**
  - Breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks and setting mini-deadlines helped in better tracking progress.

- **Code Reviews:**
  - Regularly reviewing AI-generated code for quality and consistency is crucial.
