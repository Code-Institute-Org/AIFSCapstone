- **Accessibility:**
  - Implemented ARIA labels and keyboard navigation, making the website accessible to a wider audience.
- **Responsive Design:**
  - The website layout adapted well to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Challenges:**
- **Integration of AI-Generated Code:**
  - Some AI-generated code snippets required significant modification to meet project requirements.
  - Ensuring consistency in the design and coding style when integrating AI-generated elements was challenging.
- **Time Management:**
  - Balancing time between coding, testing, and documentation was a learning curve. Initially, too much time was spent on design, which caused a rush during the implementation phase.

**Learnings:**
- **Better Planning:**
  - Breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks and setting mini-deadlines helped in better tracking progress.
- **Code Reviews:**
  - Regularly reviewing AI-generated code for quality and consistency is crucial.
- **Continuous Testing:**
  - Frequent testing during the development phase helps in identifying and fixing issues early, reducing last-minute stress.

**Proposed Improvements:**
- **Enhanced AI Tool Usage:**
  - Explore more advanced features of GitHub Copilot for code optimization.
  - Use AI tools for automated testing and validation in future projects.
- **Improved Documentation:**
  - Maintain a more detailed and continuous log of decisions and changes made during the project.
- **Time Management:**
  - Allocate specific time slots for each phase and stick to the schedule more rigorously.

**Final Thoughts:**
- The project was a valuable learning experience in integrating AI tools with web development.
- The challenges encountered provided significant learning opportunities that will inform future projects.
- Overall, the project outcomes met the initial objectives, and the use of AI tools added efficiency and innovation to the development process.

## Plagiarism Guidelines for Learners

### Project Overview Section
**Guidelines on AI Tool Usage:**
- **Use Responsibly:** While using AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ensure that the code you submit is your own. You should be able to explain all AI-generated content.
- **Document Usage:** Clearly document where and how AI tools were used in your project, specifying the contributions made by AI versus your own work.

### Pre-Implementation Artefacts Section
**Progress Submissions:**
- **Intermediate Deliverables:** Submit drafts of your project plan, wireframes, and initial code. These should show the evolution of your project and your understanding at each stage.

### Documentation Section
**Version Control Analysis:**
- **Regular Commits:** Make regular commits to your version control system (e.g., GitHub) to document your progress. Each commit should have a clear message detailing the changes made.
- **Detailed Contribution Reports:** Include a report explaining your contributions at each stage of the project. Clearly differentiate between AI-generated code and your own work.

**Plagiarism Detection:**
- **Use of Tools:** Be aware that plagiarism detection tools will be used to scan your code and documentation for similarities with other sources. Ensure that all content is original or properly cited.

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Project Plan and User Stories (10%)
