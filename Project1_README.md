## Learning Outcomes and Assessment Criteria
### Documentation of Learning Outcomes
- **LO1.1:** Document and implement all User Stories and map them to the project within an Agile tool.
- **LO1.2:** Implement custom HTML and CSS code to create a responsive Full-Stack application consisting of one or more HTML pages with relevant responses to user actions and a set of data manipulation functions.
- **LO1.5:** Use an Agile tool to manage the planning and implementation of all significant functionality.
- **LO1.6:** Document and implement all User Stories and map them to the project goals.
- **LO1.8:** Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub.
- **LO1.9:** Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (indentation, consistent, and meaningful naming conventions).
- **LO1.10:** Name files consistently and descriptively without spaces or capitalization to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
- **LO1.12:** Document the UX design work undertaken for this project, including any wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc., created as part of the design process and its reasoning.
- **LO1.14:** Implement AI-augmented enhancements to document the models and code.
- **LO8:** Present a project solution for assessment evaluation. Presentation will evidence resilience behaviours critical for software development in a team environment focusing on a solution-oriented mindset, accurate task estimation, personal accountability, effective handling of distractions, problem-solving skills, adherence to consistent coding practices, and the adoption of Agile methodologies.
- **LO9:** Develop proficiency in AI-augmented web development.
- **LO10:** Enhance code quality and problem-solving skills.
- **LO11:** Critically assess and integrate AI-generated code.
- **LO12:** Adapt to evolving web development trends.
