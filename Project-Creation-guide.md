## Design Documentation
### Wireframes
- **Wireframes:** Include wireframes for each key page of the project.
- **Annotations:** Provide annotations and explanations for design choices.

### UX Design
- **Principles:** Document the UX design principles applied to the project.
- **Accessibility:** Include accessibility considerations and audits.
- **User Interactions:** Describe user interactions and navigation flow.
- **Design Artifacts:** Attach UX flow diagrams, accessibility audits, and other relevant artifacts.

## Version Control Practices
- **Repository Setup:** Detail the GitHub repository setup and branching strategy.
- **Commit History:** Summarize the commit history with clear messages.

## AI Tool Usage
- **GitHub Copilot:** Document how GitHub Copilot was used to generate user stories and code snippets.
- **DALL-E:** Explain how DALL-E was used to generate images for the project.

- **Responsiveness:** Ensure the front-end design is responsive and interactive.
- **Testing:** Document testing procedures and results.

## Final Project Submission
- **Deployment:** Provide the link to the deployed web application and explain the deployment process.
- **Source Code:** Ensure the source code repository is complete and well-documented.

## Retrospective Report
- **Development Process:** Review the development process, identifying successes and areas for improvement.
- **User Stories:** Summarize which user stories were met and propose solutions for any unmet stories.
- **Reflections:** Provide reflections on lessons learned and future improvements.

## Mapped Learning Outcomes and Assessment Criteria
- **Learning Outcomes:**
  - **LO1.1:** Document and implement all User Stories and map them to the project within an Agile tool.
  - **LO1.2:** Implement custom HTML and CSS code to create a responsive Full-Stack application consisting of one or more HTML pages with relevant responses to user actions and a set of data manipulation functions.
  - **LO1.5:** Use an Agile tool to manage the planning and implementation of all significant functionality.
  - **LO1.6:** Document and implement all User Stories and map them to the project goals.
  - **LO1.8:** Demonstrate and document the development process through a version control system such as GitHub.
  - **LO1.9:** Write code that meets minimum standards for readability (indentation, consistent, and meaningful naming conventions).
  - **LO1.10:** Name files consistently and descriptively without spaces or capitalization to allow for cross-platform compatibility.
  - **LO1.12:** Document the UX design work undertaken for this project, including any wireframes, mockups, diagrams, etc., created as part of the design process and its reasoning.
  - **LO1.14:** Implement AI-augmented enhancements to document the models and code.
  - **LO8:** Present a project solution for assessment evaluation. Presentation will evidence resilience behaviours critical for software development in a team environment focusing on a solution-oriented mindset, accurate task estimation, personal accountability, effective handling of distractions, problem-solving skills, adherence to consistent coding practices, and the adoption of Agile methodologies.
  - **LO9:** Develop proficiency in AI-augmented web development.
  - **LO10:** Enhance code quality and problem-solving skills.
  - **LO11:** Critically assess and integrate AI-generated code.
  - **LO12:** Adapt to evolving web development trends.
