## Ensuring the Learner Has a Clear Guide to Creating a Successful Project

### Rubric

The detailed assessment rubric provides clear criteria for evaluating each aspect of the project. It is divided into three main sections: Pre-Implementation Artefacts, Project Implementation, and Post-Implementation Review. Each section has specific criteria with examples to illustrate what constitutes a fail, pass, and commendation.

- **Pre-Implementation Artefacts (30%):** Includes project plan and user stories, design documentation, version control setup, and AI tool usage plan.
- **Project Implementation (50%):** Covers code quality and standards, AI-generated code integration, and functional implementation.
- **Post-Implementation Review (20%):** Encompasses final project submission, documentation, and retrospective report.

### Implementation Guide

The implementation guide provides a phased approach to the project, ensuring learners can manage their time effectively and avoid last-minute panic. It includes detailed instructions for each phase, from initial planning to final submission, and aligns with the rubric to ensure all criteria are met.

- **Phase 1: Initial Planning**
- **Phase 2: Design and Documentation**
- **Phase 3: Initial Implementation**
- **Phase 4: AI Integration and Enhancement**
- **Phase 5: Functional Implementation and Testing**
- **Phase 6: Final Review and Submission**

### Documentation Template

The documentation template ensures continuous documentation throughout the project timeline. It includes sections for project overview, scope and objectives, user stories, wireframes, UX design, version control practices, AI tool usage, code quality and standards, functional implementation, final project submission, and retrospective.

- **Project Overview**
- **Project Scope and Objectives**
- **User Stories**
- **Wireframes**
- **UX Design**
- **Version Control Practices**
- **AI Tool Usage**
- **Code Quality and Standards**
- **Functional Implementation**
- **Final Project Submission**
- **Retrospective**

## Ensuring the Resultant Project is Worthy of a Junior Software Developer

### Code Quality and Standards

The rubric emphasizes high code quality, consistent indentation, meaningful naming conventions, and adherence to HTML5/CSS3 standards. This ensures that the learner's code is readable, maintainable, and meets industry standards.

### AI-Generated Code Integration

Effective and innovative use of AI tools is encouraged, with a focus on critical assessment and optimization of AI-generated code. This demonstrates the learner's ability to integrate advanced tools into their workflow and adapt AI-generated content to meet specific project requirements.

### Functional Implementation

The project must meet all user stories' acceptance criteria, ensuring a fully functional web application. This includes a responsive design, accessibility considerations, and a seamless user experience, reflecting the skills expected of a junior software developer.

## Ensuring Assessment Academic Integrity

### Plagiarism Guidelines

Clear guidelines are provided to prevent plagiarism, emphasizing the importance of original work and proper citation of external resources. Learners must document the use of AI tools, progress, and contributions, ensuring transparency and accountability.

### Documentation and Version Control

Regular commits with descriptive messages are required to document progress and contributions. This practice not only aids in tracking development but also provides a clear record for assessors to verify the originality and authenticity of the work.

### Critical Assessment of AI Tools

Learners are required to critically assess AI-generated code for quality and relevance, making necessary adjustments to ensure it fits their project requirements. This demonstrates their understanding and ability to work with AI tools responsibly.
