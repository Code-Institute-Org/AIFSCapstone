# Overview
The Assessment mechanism is broken into 3 main artefacts (based on the first project)
- An assessment rubric aligned to the learning outcomes
- A project implementation guide
- A project documentation template


## Rubric overview
This rubric is designed to assess the AI-Augmented Pair Programming Project. It evaluates pre-implementation artefacts, project implementation, and post-implementation review, focusing on learner contributions and adherence to project requirements.

####  Artefacts to be graded
#### Pre-Implementation Artefacts (30%)
#### Project Implementation (50%)
#### Post-Implementation Review (20%)




## AI-Augmented Pair Programming Project Guide
This guide will walk learners through the process of planning, implementing, and reviewing your project, leveraging AI tools such as GitHub Copilot and DALL-E to enhance your development experience. Follow this guide step-by-step to ensure a successful project outcome.




## Project Documentation Guide
This guide will provide learners with the scope of documentation requirements and supporting artefacts







# Outstanding Questions
- Will all apsects of a succesfully submitted project be taught prior to commencement
  
- How can the learner self diagnose project strengths/gaps when planning/implementing their projects?
  - Bootamp students:
    - Copilot?
  - PT learners:
    - ASA(with GEN AI API calls)?
  -  What are the limitations?

- How do we maintain academic integrity?
  - Use Copilot to review pre-implementaiton artefacts?
  - Continue with Copyleaks(s) to review against existing repos?
