**Commendation (7-10%):**
- **Evidence:** Detailed wireframes and comprehensive UX design documentation, including accessibility considerations and user interaction details.
- **Example:** Wireframes for each page (homepage, services/products, contact) with detailed notes on layout, navigation, and accessibility features like ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

### Version Control Setup (5%)

**Fail (0-2%):**
- **Evidence:** GitHub repository not properly set up. Minimal commits.
- **Example:** Only one branch with initial commit.

**Pass (3%):**
- **Evidence:** Basic setup of GitHub repository with a simple branching strategy.
- **Example:** Main branch and one feature branch with commits for initial setup.

**Commendation (4-5%):**
- **Evidence:** Well-organized GitHub repository with regular commits documenting key stages of development.
- **Example:** Main branch, development branch, and multiple feature branches with regular commits.

### AI Tool Usage Plan (5%)

**Fail (0-2%):**
- **Evidence:** Missing or unclear plan for using AI tools.
- **Example:** No mention of AI tool usage in the project plan.

**Pass (3%):**
- **Evidence:** Basic description of AI tool usage in the project.
- **Example:** "Use GitHub Copilot for generating HTML/CSS code."

**Commendation (4-5%):**
- **Evidence:** Detailed plan for AI tool usage, highlighting key stages and expected benefits.
- **Example:** "Use GitHub Copilot for generating user stories, HTML structure, and CSS enhancements. Use DALL-E for creating images."

## Project Implementation (50%)

### Code Quality and Standards (15%)

**Fail (0-6%):**
- **Evidence:** Poor code quality with inconsistent indentation, naming conventions, and poor use of HTML5/CSS3 standards.
- **Example:** Code with mixed indentation styles, non-descriptive variable names, and invalid HTML/CSS.

**Pass (7-9%):**
- **Evidence:** Basic code quality with mostly consistent indentation and naming conventions. Some adherence to HTML5/CSS3 standards.
- **Example:** Code with consistent indentation and descriptive names, but minor HTML/CSS issues.

**Commendation (10-15%):**
- **Evidence:** High code quality with consistent indentation, meaningful naming conventions, and good adherence to HTML5/CSS3 standards.
- **Example:** Well-structured code with consistent indentation, descriptive names, and valid HTML/CSS.

### AI-Generated Code Integration (15%)

**Fail (0-6%):**
- **Evidence:** Poor or ineffective use of AI tools. Minimal integration of AI-generated code.
- **Example:** Generated code not used or poorly integrated into the project.

**Pass (7-9%):**
- **Evidence:** Basic use of AI tools with some integration and critical assessment of AI-generated code.
- **Example:** AI-generated code is used but not thoroughly reviewed or optimized.

**Commendation (10-15%):**
- **Evidence:** Effective and innovative use of AI tools with good integration and critical assessment of AI-generated code.
- **Example:** AI-generated code is integrated, reviewed, and optimized for project requirements.

### Functional Implementation (20%)

**Fail (0-6%):**
- **Evidence:** Incomplete or non-functional implementation. User stories' acceptance criteria not met.
- **Example:** Homepage missing key sections, broken links, or non-functional features.

**Pass (7-9%):**
