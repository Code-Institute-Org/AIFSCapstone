# Detailed Assessment Rubric for AI-Augmented Pair Programming Project

## Overall Pass and Noteworthy Grades

### Overall Grading Criteria

### Pass
**Criteria:**
- Achieve a minimum overall score of 50%.
- No component (Pre-Implementation Artefacts, Project Implementation, Post-Implementation Review) falls below a pass mark in its category.
- Basic adherence to project requirements, showing understanding and execution of the project plan, user stories, design, and implementation.

**Justification:**
- A pass indicates the learner has met the essential requirements of the project, demonstrating a foundational understanding and ability to execute the tasks, albeit with potential for improvement in detail and execution. This level of achievement is considered sufficient to demonstrate the skills necessary to secure a job in the field.

### Noteworthy
**Criteria:**
- Achieve an overall score of 70% or higher.
- All components (Pre-Implementation Artefacts, Project Implementation, Post-Implementation Review) are executed to a high standard, with exceptional detail and quality.
- Comprehensive and detailed project plan, user stories, design documentation, exceptional code quality, seamless AI integration, and flawless functional implementation.

**Justification:**
- A noteworthy rating represents a high level of achievement, indicating exceptional understanding and execution. This recognition is reserved for work that is not only free of significant issues but is also innovative, detailed, and exceptionally well-documented, reflecting a deep understanding and mastery of the project requirements and tools. However, it is important to note that noteworthy feedback is not a formal grade but rather an acknowledgment of exceptional work beyond the standard expectations.

**Note to Learners:**
- Achieving a pass grade is sufficient to demonstrate the competencies required to pursue a career in the field. While noteworthy feedback highlights exceptional work, it is not a formal grade category. Employers value the practical skills and understanding you have developed through this project, and a pass grade is a strong indicator of your readiness for the job market.
